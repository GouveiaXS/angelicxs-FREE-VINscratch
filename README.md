Free VIN Scratch for FiveM

I have created a free vehicle heist for use in ESX and QBcore servers.

Criminals will go speak to the VIN dealer to request a vehicle to boost. After finding the vehicle, police will be provided a tracking device to chase the criminal. Once in range of the drop off point the tracker will turn off and the criminal will need to lose the cops in order to complete the drop off. At drop off they will have the choice to keep their vehicle and have it added to the garage or deliver the vehicle for payment.

- Config allows for a highly customized heist
- Over 20 pre-included vehicles to be selected randomly each heist
- Over 8 pre-included delivery points to be selected randomly each heist
- Over 125 pre-included starting points to be selected randomly each heist
- Idles at 0.00ms
